                <p class="text-justify">With all the bells and whistles on modern cars it can be extremely difficult for you to know what the problem is with your vehicle.

                <p class="text-justify">Modern vehicles have multiple on-board computers. It is no longer possible to carry out the full range of repairs and maintenance on your car without being able to work with these computers. To enable us to do this, so that we can accurately diagnose faults and carry out repairs, we have recently purchased the high tech ‘Global Scan’ tool.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">This tool is configured for the worldwide ‘CAN’ protocol and features multi-range control system coverage enabling us to identify and fix faults with ABS, SRS, ETS, climate control, ECM, immobiliser and instrument cluster systems, among many more. It also supports extended functions such as activation, reset basic settings, adaptation, repair guide etc</p>

                <h2 class="weight-300 letter-spacing-1 size-19"><span style="color:white!important;">WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS IS THAT WHILE OTHERS GUESS, WE KNOW HOW TO FIX WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR CAR.</span></h2>
